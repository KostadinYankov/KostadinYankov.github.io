BMW aims to make this fascinating driving experience even more intense in the future. The driver is in constant communication with the vehicle in an intuitive and natural way. At the same time, the vehicle expands the driver’s range of perception and transforms him or her into the “Ultimate Driver” – the best driver they can possibly be. The Companion responds to the driver’s personal needs in order to create emotionally-intense experiences.The Vision 100 also ushers in a wildly futuristic tech feature called Alive Geometry that’s made up of nearly 800 moving triangles scattered across the instrument panel and the body panels. In Boost mode, the triangles change color to warn the driver of oncoming vehicles or obstacles in the road, and to highlight the fastest driving line — it’s like a digital driving school. In Ease mode, the triangles warn the passengers if the car is about to make a sharp turn or an abrupt stop so that they’re not caught off-guard — in this case, it’s like a digital backseat driver.</div>

                        Glasses instead of a helmet, light clothing, full balance without a stand: just three of a great many aspects which could become standard in motorcycling and give that feeling of freedom a new dimension in an increasingly digitalised world. And the best thing about it: this vision vehicle is already here. Introducing the BMW Motorrad VISION NEXT 100. Freedom means experiencing the environment with all your senses, and feeling centrifugal forces, acceleration and the wind. Ideally without a helmet or protective clothing. And with the BMW Motorrad VISION NEXT 100, you don't need this any more either. Because the "digital companion" – a functional unit consisting of motorcycle and our own version of rider's equipment – ensures a high degree of safety. The digital companion acts imperceptibly in the background and always intervenes when required or desired. "It was important to us that the analogue riding experience would remain undisturbed. The display and operating concept acts so discreetly that it creates a natural and familiar movement," explains Holger Hampf, head of design, customer experience, at the BMW Group.</div>

It allows the creation of products with a design and functional range that express individuality and meet the wide variety of requirements of those who are using them. GINA produces dramatically different solutions that affect the design and functionality of future cars. The GINA's innovative body is underpinned by wires or flexible carbon struts where movement is needed, such as in ducts, doors and rear spoiler. There are no gaps between body and door, for example, as the flexible fabric acts like a hinge itself. When not needed, the headlights are covered by the fabric skin, and turn signals are likewise invisible until they are switched on, revealing only their light source through the translucent skin.</div>
